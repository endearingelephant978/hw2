    <h1>RESPONSIVE REDESIGN</h1>

    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

    <p>
        This project is a redesign of a website that has a few usability and accessibility problems. First I analyze
        these problems, then I make low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for a redesign that addresses these
        problems, and finally I code a responsive page based on those prototypes.

    <p>
        The website I chose to analyze is the landing page for my favorite restaurant from my hometown, and while this
        is actually already a more recent redesign of their website (the older one left even more to be desired), there
        are still a few design problems to be addressed.
    </p>

    <h2>ORIGINAL DESIGN ANALYSIS</h2>

    <h4>USABILITY PROBLEMS</h4>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">PROBLEM</th>
                <th scope="col">EXAMPLE</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">superfluous links</th>
                <td>
                    there are four separate links in the top half of the page that all take you to the online ordering
                    page (grated because three of them are attached to the scrolling pictures, you only ever see at most
                    two at once, but this is still more than is necessary)
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">misuse of spacing</th>
                <td>
                    there is inconsistently a lot of space around every element; this isn't just an aesthetic issue, as
                    the options in the navbar at the top of the page can be a bit hard to parse at first glance because
                    the spacing is inconsistent
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">misuse of ordering</th>
                <td>
                    the space for content at top of the page is not well utilized; most of the information there isn't
                    helpful for new users (but instead shows up further down on the page), and the online ordering
                    buttons should be even more prominent for experienced users to be able to beeline straight to them
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">misleading links</th>
                <td>
                    there is a link on the page connected to a Google icon, and on the mobile site (but not on the
                    desktop site for some reason) the text “Follow Us!” appears next to it, which implies some sort of
                    Google social media site, but instead the link takes you to Google maps with the destination set to
                    the address of the restaurant
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>ACCESSIBILITY PROBLEMS</h4>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">PROBLEM</th>
                <th scope="col">EXAMPLE</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">excessive bandwidth</th>
                <td>
                    three (out of a total seven) links that bring you back to this exact page actually unnecessarily
                    reload the page, which causes an accessibility issue by using extra internet bandwidth when not
                    required
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">text-on-image contrast</th>
                <td>
                    the white text on the pictures overlaps with the food detail on the righthand side of the picture,
                    making it hard to read (which only happens on mobile, so this actually could be addressed as a
                    scaling issue)
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">missing alternative text</th>
                <td>
                    according to the WAVE tool, there are some pictures on the page that are missing alternative text,
                    which could cause trouble for people using screen readers
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>LO-FI WIREFRAMES</h2>

    <p>
        The following are lo-fi wireframe sketches for a redesign that address the issues I found in my analysis. There
        is a desktop wireframe, a tablet wireframe, and a mobile wireframe. Each design choice is annotated with number
        that corresponds to the usability/accessibility problem being addressed:
    <ol>
        <li>
            superfluous links → collapsed all four different "order" buttons into one
        </li>
        <li>
            misuse of spacing → appropriately spaced separate elements in footer
        </li>
        <li>
            misuse of ordering → put key features of the website in a more natural order
        </li>
        <li>
            misleading links → reskinned the Google maps link to make its function clearer
        </li>
        <li>
            excessive bandwidth → removed links that unnecessarily reloaded the page
        </li>
        <li>
            text-on-image contrast → moved pictures out from behind any text
        </li>
        <li>
            missing alternative text → (intend to) include alternative text for all images
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>VISUAL DESIGN STYLE GUIDE</h2>

    <p>
        The following is a simple visual design style guide made in Figma that covers all the components I'll need for
        my hi-fi prototypes.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>HI-FI PROTOTYPES</h2>

    <p>
        The following are three high-fidelity prototypes made in Figma for desktop, tablet, and mobile, based on the prior low-fidelity sketches. (Note that the text content is still just a placeholder.)
    </p>

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">DESKTOP</th>
                <th scope="col">TABLET</th>
                <th scope="col">MOBILE</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images\hifi\desktop.png" style="width: 100%;">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images\hifi\tablet.png" style="width: 100%;">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images\hifi\mobile.png" style="width: 100%;">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Additionally, here is the annotated version of the hi-fi prototypes with implementation specifications.

    <h2>RESPONSIVE WEBPAGE</h2>
    <p>
        Now, based on my hi-fi prototypes and my implementation annotations, I have attempted to make a responsive webpage that in theory would have fixed all the usability problems I found in the original page. You can view the website <a href="/redesign.html">here</a>.
